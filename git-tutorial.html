    <h1>Git Tutorial</h1>
    <h3>Author: Bernie Cassidy</h3>
    <h3>Institution: Occidental College</h3>
    

<h2>I. Introduction</h2>
<p>
    Welcome, honored student, to the wide world of Git. 
</p>
<p>
    As ChatGPT once said, "Git is a powerful version control system widely used in software development."<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup> Git is useful for writing code by yourself or as part of a large team. It lets you coordinate your work with others, track changes that have been made, and lets you revert to older versions of your code.
</p>
<p>
In this tutorial, you will learn how to use Git, specifically from the command line interface (CLI). While graphical user interfaces such as GitHub are popular among Git users, understanding the command line interface will allow you more flexibility and deeper mastery of Git.
</p>
<p>
    
    By the end of the tutorial, you'll have a solid foundation of Git knowledge and will be well-prepared to start using Git for your own projects. We'll walk through the basic setup of Git and create a sample project, learn fundamental concepts like commits and branches, and finally move on to the trickier tasks of resolving conflicts and incorporating changes from different branches.
</p>
<p>
    Now... let's Git it done!<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>
</p>

<h2>II. Setting Up Git</h2>
<p>
    The first step is to set up Git on your computer. Git is available on a number of operating systems, which each have their own installation process. Follow these steps to install Git, but keep in mind that you need to follow your own machine's instructions:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Download Git from the official website: <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads" target="_blank">https://git-scm.com/downloads</a>.</li>
    <li>Run the downloaded installer and follow the on-screen instructions. Make sure to select the appropriate options for your operating system.</li>
    <li>Once the installation is complete, open a terminal or command prompt and verify that Git has been installed correctly by running the following command:
        <pre><code>git --version</code></pre>
        You should see the installed version of Git printed in the terminal.<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    After installing Git, you'll need to configure it with your name and email address in order to identify your future commits. Run the following commands in your terminal or command prompt, but replace "Your Name" and "yourname@email.com" with your actual name and email address:
</p>
<pre><code>git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "yourname@email.com"</code></pre>
<p>
    Congratulations! You have installed Git and you're now ready to start coding!
</p>

<h2>III. Creating a Project</h2>
<p>
    In this section, you will create a sample project, which I have decided will be a Python application for managing a grocery list. This application will allow users to add items to their list, remove items, and display the current list of groceries.
</p>
<p>
    Follow these steps to create the grocery list application:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Create a new directory for your project. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the location where you want to create your project directory.</li>
    <li>Run the following command to create a new directory named "grocery-list":
        <pre><code>mkdir grocery-list</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>Navigate into the newly created directory:
        <pre><code>cd grocery-list</code></pre>
    </li>
    <li>Create a Python file named <code>grocery_list.py</code> in your project directory:
        <pre><code>touch grocery_list.py</code></pre>

</li>
    <li>Open your text editor/IDE and create your application.<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
    Assuming you followed step 5, you now have a fully functional grocery list application. Now the next step will be initializing a repository in Git so that you can make and track changes to your project.
</p>

<h2>IV. Initializing a Git Repository</h2>
<p>
A repository is your project's home base, where the project's files and their revision histories are stored. When you initialize a directory as your Git repository, Git creates a hidden folder that stores your project's commits, branches, and tags. The following steps will help you initialize a repository:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>In your terminal or command line, navigate to the root directory of your project (the directory containing <code>grocery_list.py</code>).</li>
    <li>Run the following command to initialize a Git repository:
        <pre><code>git init</code></pre>
        This command initializes an empty Git repository in the current directory.
    </li>
    <li>Check to make sure your repository was initialized:
        <pre><code>git status</code></pre>
        You should see a message that says that you're on the main branch and there are no commits yet.
    </li>
    <li>Run the following command to add <code>grocery_list.py</code> to the staging area:
        <pre><code>git add grocery_list.py</code></pre>
        This command stages the changes made to <code>grocery_list.py</code> for the next commit.
    </li>
    <li>Finally, commit your changes to the repository, along with a commit message:
        <pre><code>git commit -m "Initial commit: Add grocery list application"</code></pre>
        You will typically want your commit message to be a description of the changes that you have made, especially in a team project.<sup><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
Your project is safe! Now that you've made a repository, Git will track changes to your project and allow you to revert to previous versions.</p>

<h2>V. Commits</h2>
<p>
The previous section outlined most of the commands used to make commits, which you will want to do whenever you have made changes to your project.  After a file has been edited or new files have been added, you can use the <code>git status</code> command to see which files in your directory have been changed. Then use the <code>git add</code> command to add the files you want to commit to your staging area. Once you are done staging your changes, you can commit them to your repository with the <code>git commit</code> command.
</p>
<p>
    The <code>git log</code> command is a simple tool that allows you to view your project's history. Navigating to your project directory and running this command will display the commit history, with the most recent commits appearing first. Each commit in the log includes the following information:
</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Commit Hash:</strong> A unique 40-character hexadecimal string representing the commit.</li>
    <li><strong>Author:</strong> The name and email address of the author who made the commit.</li>
    <li><strong>Date:</strong> The date and time when the commit was made.</li>
    <li><strong>Commit Message:</strong> A description of the changes made by this commit.</li>
</ul>
<p>
As discussed in the previous section, you will usually want to add a concise, yet descriptive, message that outlines the changes you have made to the project. Frequent commits will let you track how your project grows and changes over time, and will allow you to easily restore past versions of the project if you feel you have made a mistake.<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup>
</p>

<h2>VI. Working with Branches</h2>
<p>
    A branch is a version of your project that is separate from your "main" repository. Branches in Git let you work on editing or fixing certain parts of your project without worrying about how experimenting might affect your main project.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>
</p>
<p>
    Here is a step-by-step guide for using commands to create a branch, making changes in a branch, and then merging the branch back into the main repository:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>To create a new branch, use the <code>git branch</code> command followed by the branch's name. For example, to create a new branch named "new-branch", run:</li>
    <pre><code>git branch new-branch</code></pre>
    <li>Switch to a branch using the <code>git checkout</code> command:</li>
    <pre><code>git checkout new-branch</code></pre>
    <li>Now you're on the "new-branch" branch, where you can make changes to your project independently of other branches. After making changes and committing them to the branch, you may want to merge your changes back into the main branch ("main"). To do this, first switch to the main branch:</li>
    <pre><code>git checkout main</code></pre>
    <li>Then, merge the changes from the branch into the main branch using the <code>git merge</code> command:</li>
    <pre><code>git merge new-branch</code></pre>
    <li>Resolve any merge conflicts if they occur (more on this in the next section), commit the changes, and push the merged branch to the remote repository:</li>
    <pre><code>git push origin new-branch</code></pre>
    <li>The <code>git push</code> and <code>git pull</code> commands help you connect your local repository and the remote repository. Pushing updates the remote repository with your local repository, while pulling updates your local repository with the remote one.</li>
</ol>

<h2>VII. Conflicts</h2>
<p>
	Because Git is managing changes from multiple contributors at the same time, separate changes can cause a conflict when you try to merge two branches. 
    Git's ability to manage concurrent changes from multiple contributors may sometimes result in conflicts when merging branches with conflicting changes. A conflict occurs when Git is unable to automatically merge changes due to conflicting edits made to the same part of a file.
</p>
<p>
When a conflict occurs, Git will mark the conflicting sections in the affected files. Open the files in a text editor to view and resolve the conflicts, which will be marked automatically. You will need to edit the file and choose which changes to keep. After resolving the conflicts, save the files, stage them, and commit the changes. A commit message that summarizes the conflict resolution will be automatically generated by Git. Now you can run the <code>git merge</code> command again to merge.

<h2>VIII. Stashing</h2>
<p>
    If you have unfinished changes in a branch that you don't want to commit yet, you can "stash" them to temporarily store your changes while you work on another branch. Running the <code>git stash</code> command in a branch will save your current changes and return your working directory to what it looked like after its last commit. The <code>git stash apply</code> command brings back your stashed changes. It is possible to have multiple stashes, but you will need to refer to each stash by its reference, which is found using the <code>git stash list</code> command.
    </p>

<h2>IX. Conclusion</h2>
<p>
    Congratulations! You're done. You've learned essential Git concepts and commands, and you know how to initialize a repository, make commits, create and merge branches, stash changes, and resolve conflicts. This knowledge will help you create and manage your own projects as well as work as a member of a larger coding team. Git is an extremely powerful and useful tool, and you now have it at your disposal. You must now venture out on your own, and hopefully one day you will surpass my knowledge of Git and begin to teach others as I have taught you.

    <sup id="fn7a">7a. Kind of like how you work on experimental code in a branch instead of the main repository? Are these footnotes just textual branches? Important questions are being raised.</sup><br>
